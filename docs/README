Aftertime framework
=====================

- Be aware of the underlying system and adapt to it (i.e. HTTP server, available modules, etc)
- High-level meets low level
- Based on external PHP components. Get features by upgrading the external dependencies
- No dead-tech support. Removed on sight
- Very lightweigh "App" base class
- Good logging and debugging mechanism
- Combine existent technologies. Don't reinvent the wheel
- Scale your site from unprivileged shared server to multiserver
- Multiple deployment: the same commands allow you to use the build site from the development environment, deploy it in a shared hosting configuration, or in a multiple server one with replicated tiers.
- Multiple site development within the same aftertime instance. Note that this does not mean "multisite"
