Aftertime framework

Dependencies
================

	Not much required; a lot of things are bundled and it does not even require a database.
	Officially: stable version of the software, that's not being unsupported for more than 6 months. The framework should check for this.
	PHP +5.3
	Support Mysql 5.1 (dreamhost)
	php-json, php-pear
